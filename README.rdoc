* Local development

Switch the
    RPC::JSON::Client.new 
line inside    
    btc_remote.rb 
to your local machine.

Start your local bitcoid using 
    bitcoind -regtest -printtoconsole

* Tests

For the time being you will have to have your local bitcoin running or the tests will fail.

    bundle exec rspec
