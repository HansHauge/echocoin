<h3>Echo... what now?</h3>
<p>
  Echocoin is a bitcoin payment service with something a little extra. Each time
  you send a transaction you will contribute to a charity of your choice and you will
  also be entered into each of the prize pools.
</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
  Echocoin is a three-way partnership between the charities, the developers and
  you! Small donations have a way of adding up and hey; it's kind of exciting! Just
  by using Echocoin you have a chance to win each of the prize pools. If you're
  lucky enough you could even win more than one pool.
</p>

<h3>Anything else I should know?</h3>
<p>
  Yes, since you are doing the lord's work here, you can also enter your email
  address to get a charitable donation certificate. If you choose to enter your
  email you will also get notified if you win a prize pool.
